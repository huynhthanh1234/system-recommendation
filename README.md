# An Efficient Scientific Submission Recommendation System for Computer Science

Our paper can be found  at 

In this paper, we have researched the Recommendation System that can predict which journal fit with your paper. We use the dataset of authors in this paper 


#  Requirements

This code has been tested with 
python 3.6.8 in https://colab.research.google.com
packages:  pandas, numpy,  textblob, nltk, re, scikit-learn and pickle 

#  Dataset

This dataset has 9347 documents in the training dataset and 4665 documents in the testing dataset, which are classiﬁed into 65 diﬀerent categories (journals or conferences)

## Data Preprocessing

In this section you can read our paper to know  more, example:
|               |  Original     | After pre-processed              |          
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| Title         | " Fighting malicious code: an eternal struggle"  |" ﬁght malici code etern struggl"        |
| Abstract      | "Despite many years of research and signiﬁcant commercial investment, the malware problem is far from being solved (or even reasonably well contained)..."  | "espit year research signiﬁc commerci invest malwar problem far solv reason contain week mainstream press publish articl incid million credit card leak larg .."|
| Keyword       |  "PAC-Bayes bound, support vector machine, generalization capability prediction, classiﬁcation"|  "pac-bayes bound”, “support vector machine”, “generalization capability prediction”, “classiﬁcation"            | 

# Run
you should run this code in https://colab.research.google.com
Firstly, pushing 2 data re_data_train and re_data_test
and all file .sav
Secondly,  run step by step according to my instructions in the code
